    "# PROJECT 2: Part 2 - Web Scrape and Analysis\n",
    "### Paulina Mostek\n",
    "### Objective: Setup a web scraping pipeline to scrape data from at least five pages from https://www.basketball-reference.com/. \n",
    "* Place the data in a pandas DataFrame,\n",
    "* Clean the data, if necessary\n",
    "* Perform data analysis that answers a minimum of four questions about the data.\n",
    "* Answers should be given programmatically as output and at least two questions should have answers demonstrated via a plot, utilizing Seaborn.\n",
    "* Plot analysis should include data labels, and a title that summarizes your conclusion, and styling should be applied.\n",
    "* Restriction: Crawl/request delay of 3 seconds must be followed as per robots.txt on basketball-reference.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We will scrape data to answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. How has LeBron James’ scoring efficiency (TS%, PER) changed over the last 10 years?\n",
    "2. Which teams in the eastern conference had the best win-lose percentage and how does it correlate with opponent points per game?\n",
    "3. In the 2024-25 season, how does the Lakers' performance compare to their opponents? Judge stats like field goal percentage, total rebounds, and total points.\n",
    "4. Which coaches of the 2024-2025 season had the highest win ratio?\n",
    "5. What impact do the Round 1 2024 draft members with the top 10 points-per-game have on their team wins? Assess points per game (PTS), assists (AST), and win shares (WS) among the top 10 points-per-game draft players. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### We will be using the following webpages:\n",
    "1. Lakers 2024-25 Season https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2025.html\n",
    "2. 2024-25 Season Summary (includes Eastern Conference) https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025.html\n",
    "3. Lebron: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html\n",
    "4. 2024-2025 Coaches: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025_coaches.html\n",
    "5. 2024 NBA Draft: https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2024.html\n",
